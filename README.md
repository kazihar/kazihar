### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a full-stack engineer, who loves building cool products and wear any hats for presented problem, working in projects of various sectors, experienced in designing and building critical features, keeping user experience in mind, scalability, and maintainability.

My contribution in my organisation is mostly on designing, building and maintaining cloud infrastructure, backend APIs & services, improving code quality, as well as exploring and partaking in system design for various components / projects.

Skilled in Javascript / Typescript (React / Express / NodeJS/ NestJs), Sprinboot, PostgreSQL, MongoDb, with good experience in AWS, Machine learning and Flutter Android Development.

Profession aside, Iâ€™m a IOT and animation enthusiast, I had fun working with Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Esp 32. During my college years I've helped Electronics major under-graduates to make smart bin and smart sanitizers during covid lockdown. During my student years I used to do animations in Pivot animator/Stykz animator and Macromedia flash 8 along with 3d designing/video editing in Blender3d.
